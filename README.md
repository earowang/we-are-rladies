What I shared as a curator of [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) during the week of April 28, 2019.

## Day 01: lesser known packages for automating

* The [**whisker**](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker) package for logicless templating
* The [**tic**](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/tic/) package for working with continuous integration (CI) systems like Travis CI or AppVeyor for R projects

## Day 02: data visualisation

* The `margin` argument in `facet_grid()`
* The `facet_geo()` from Ryan Hafen's [**geofacet**](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/) for laying out panels in geographical grids
* The `facet_calendar()` from my [**sugrrants**](http://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants/) for laying out panels in calendar format.

## Day 03: rmarkdown

* `knitr::read_chunk()` reads external R files into R Markdown document
* `knitr::purl()` extracts R chunks from R Markdown into a separate R file
* Embedding [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) into xaringan slides for animating elements

## Day 04: package development

* The best intro guide to package development: Jenny's [**usethis** README](https://usethis.r-lib.org)
* Collin's slide deck [Building a package that lasts](https://github.com/ColinFay/erum2018)
* Jim's rstudio::conf 2018 talk [You can make a package in 20 minutes](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/you-can-make-a-package-in-20-minutes/)

## Day 05: research compendium

* Karthik's rstudio::conf 2019 talk [A guide to modern reproducible data science with R](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/a-guide-to-modern-reproducible-data-science-with-r)
* Ben Marwick's peej preprint [Packaging data analytical work reproducibly using R (and friends)](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192/)
