# we-are-rladies

What I shared as a curator of [@WeAreRLadies](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) during the week of April 28, 2019.

## Day 01: lesser known packages for automating

* The [whisker](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker) package for logicless templating
* The [tic](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/tic/) package for working with continuous integration (CI) systems like Travis CI or AppVeyor for R projects

## Day 02: data visualisation

* The `margin` argument in `facet_grid()`
* The `facet_geo()` from Ryan Hafen's [**geofacet**](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/) for laying out panels in geographical grids
* The `facet_calendar()` from my [**sugrrants**](http://pkg.earo.me/sugrrants/) for laying out panels in calendar format.

## Day 03: rmarkdown

* `knitr::read_chunk()` reads external R files into R Markdown document
* `knitr::purl()` extracts R chunks from R Markdown into a separate R file
* Embedding [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) into xaringan slides for animating elements
