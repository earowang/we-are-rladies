> Hey Hadley! What is the tidyverse?

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages:

* [**ggplot2**](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org): A system for 'declaratively' creating graphics,
    based on &quot;The Grammar of Graphics&quot;. You provide the data, tell 'ggplot2'
    how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use,
    and it takes care of the details.

* [**purrr**](http://purrr.tidyverse.org): A complete and consistent functional programming toolkit for R.

* [**tibble**](http://tibble.tidyverse.org): Provides a 'tbl_df' class (the 'tibble') that provides
    stricter checking and better formatting than the traditional data frame.

* [**dplyr**](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org): A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects,
    both in memory and out of memory.

* [**tidyr**](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org): An evolution of 'reshape2'. It's designed
    specifically for data tidying (not general reshaping or aggregating)
    and works well with 'dplyr' data pipelines.

* [**stringr**](http://stringr.tidyverse.org): A consistent, simple and easy to use set of
    wrappers around the fantastic 'stringi' package. All function and
    argument names (and positions) are consistent, all functions deal with
    &quot;NA&quot;'s and zero length vectors in the same way, and the output from
    one function is easy to feed into the input of another.

* [**readr**](http://readr.tidyverse.org): The goal of 'readr' is to provide a fast and friendly way to read
    rectangular data (like 'csv', 'tsv', and 'fwf'). It is designed to flexibly
    parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when
    data unexpectedly changes.

* [**forcats**](http://forcats.tidyverse.org): Helpers for reordering factor levels (including
    moving specified levels to front, ordering by first appearance,
    reversing, and randomly shuffling), and tools for modifying factor
    levels (including collapsing rare levels into other, 'anonymising',
    and manually 'recoding').
